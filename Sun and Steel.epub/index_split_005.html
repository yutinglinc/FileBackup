By now, I had made of my style something appropriate to my muscles: it had become flexible and free; all fatty embellishment had been stripped from it, while “muscular” ornament—ornament, that is, that though possibly without use in modern civilization was still as necessary as ever for purposes of prestige and presentability—had been assiduously maintained. I disliked a style that was merely functional as much as one that was merely sensuous. </p><p class="calibre_1">Nevertheless, I was on an isolated island of my own. Just as my body was isolated, so my style was on the verge of non-communication; it was a style that did not accept, but rejected. More than anything, I was preoccupied with distinction (not that my own style necessarily had it). My ideal style would have had the grave beauty of polished wood in the entrance hall of a samurai mansion on a winter’s day. </p><p class="calibre_1">In my style, as hardly needs pointing out, I progressively turned my back on the preferences of the age. Abounding in antitheses, clothed in an old-fashioned, weighty solemnity, it did not lack nobility of a kind; but it maintained the same ceremonial, grave pace wherever it went, marching through other people’s bedrooms with precisely the same tread as elsewhere. Like some military gentleman, it went about with chest out and shoulders back, despising other men’s styles for the way they stooped, sagged at the knees, even—heaven forbid!—swayed at the hips. </p><p class="calibre_1">I knew, of course, that there are some truths in this world that one cannot see unless one unbends one’s posture. But such things could well be left to others. </p><p class="calibre_1">Somewhere within me, I was beginning to plan a union of art and life, of style and the ethos of action. If style was similar to muscles and patterns of behavior, then its function was obviously to restrain the wayward imagination. Any truths that might be overlooked as a result were no concern of mine. Nor did I care one jot that the fear and horror of confusion and ambiguity eluded my style. I had made up my mind that I would select only one particular truth, and avoid aiming at any all-inclusive truth. Enervating, ugly truths I ignored; by means of a process of diplomatic selection within the spirit, I sought to avoid the morbid influence exerted on men by indulgence in the imagination. Nevertheless, it was dangerous, obviously, to underestimate or ignore its influence. There was no telling when the sickly forces of an invisible imagination, still lying in wait, might launch their cowardly assault from without the carefully arrayed fortifications of style. Day and night, I stood guard on the ramparts. Occasionally, something — a red fire — would flare up like a signal on the dark plain stretching endlessly into the night before me. I would try to tell myself that it was a bonfire. Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, the fire would vanish again. As guard and weapon against imagination and its henchman sensibility, I had style. The tension of the all-night watch, whether by land or by sea, was what I sought after in my style. More than anything, I detested defeat. Can there be any worse defeat than when one is corroded and seared from within by the acid secretions of sensibility until finally one loses one’s outline, dissolves, liquefies; or when the same thing happens to the society about one, and one alters one’s own style to match it? </p><p class="calibre_1">Everyone knows that masterpieces, ironically enough, sometimes arise from the midst of such defeat, from the death of the spirit. Though I might retreat a pace and admit such masterpieces as victories, I knew that they were victories without a struggle, battleless victories of a kind peculiar to art. What I sought was the struggle as such, whichever way it might go. I had no taste for defeat—much less victory—without a fight. At the same time, I knew only too well the deceitful nature of any kind of conflict in art. If I must have a struggle, I felt I should take the offensive in fields outside art; in art, I should defend my citadel. It was necessary to be a sturdy defender within art, and a good fighter outside it. The goal of my life was to acquire all the various attributes of the warrior. </p><p class="calibre_1">During the postwar period, when all accepted values were upset, I often thought and remarked to others that now if ever was the time for reviving the old Japanese ideal of a combination of letters and the martial arts, of art and action. For a while after that, my interest strayed from that particular ideal; then, as I gradually learned from the sun and the steel the secret of how to pursue words with the body (and not merely pursue the body with words), the two poles within me began to maintain a balance, and the generator of my mind, so to speak, switched from a direct to an alternating current. My mind devised a system that by installing within the self two mutually antipathetic elements—two elements that flowed alternately in opposite directions—gave the appearance of inducing an ever wider split in the personality, yet in practice created at each moment a living balance that was constantly being destroyed and brought back to life again. The embracing of a dual polarity within the self and the acceptance of contradiction and collision—such was my own blend of “art and action.” </p><p class="calibre_1">In this way, it seemed to me, my long-standing interest in the opposite of the literary principle began for the first time to beat fruit. The principle of the sword, it seemed, lay in its allying death not with pessimism and impotence but with abounding energy, the flower of physical perfection, and the will to fight. Nothing could be farther removed from the principle of literature. In literature, death is held in check yet at the same time used as a driving force; strength is devoted to the construction of empty fictions; life is held in reserve, blended to just the right degree with death, treated with preservatives, and lavished on the production of works of art that possess a weird eternal life. Action—one might say—perishes with the blossom; literature is an imperishable flower. And an imperishable flower, of course, is an artificial flower. </p><p class="calibre_1">Thus to combine action and art is to combine the flower that wilts and the flower that lasts forever, to blend within one individual the two most contradictory desires in humanity, and the respective dreams of those desires’ realization. What, then, occurs as a result? </p><p class="calibre_1">To be utterly familiar with the essence of these two things—of which one must be false if the other is true— and to know completely their sources and partake of their mysteries, is secretly to destroy the ultimate dreams of one concerning the other. When action views itself as reality and art as falsehood, it entrusts this falsehood with authority for giving final endorsement to its own truth and, hoping to take advantage of the falsehood, sets it in charge of its dreams. It is thus that epic poems came to be written. On the other hand, when art considers itself as the reality and action as the falsehood, it once more envisages that falsehood as the peak of its own ultimate fictional world; it has been forced to realize that its own death is no longer backed up by the falsehood, that hard on the heels of the reality of its own work came the reality of death. This death is a fearful death, the death that descends on the human being who has never lived; yet he can at least dream, ultimately, of the existence in the world of action—the falsehood—of a death that is other than his own. </p><p class="calibre_1">By the destruction of these ultimate dreams I mean the perception of two hidden truths: that the flower of falsehood dreamed of by the man of action is no more than an artificial flower; and, on the other hand, that the death bolstered up by falsehood of which art dreams in no way confers any special favors. In short, the dual approach cuts one off from all salvation by dreams: the two secrets that should never by rights have been brought face to face see through each other. Within one body, and without flinching, the collapse of the ultimate principles of life and of death must be accepted. </p><p class="calibre_1">One may well ask if it is possible for anyone to live this duality in practice. Fortunately, it is extremely rare for the duality to assume its absolute form; it is the kind of ideal that, if realized, would be over in a moment. For the secret of this inwardly conflicting, ultimate duality is that, though it may make itself constantly foreseen in the form of a vague apprehension, it will never be put to the test until the moment of death. Then—at the very moment when the dual ideal that offers no salvation is about to be realized—the person who is preoccupied with this duality will betray that ideal from one side or the other. Since it was life that bound him to the ruthless perception of that ideal, he will betray that perception once he finds himself face to face with death. Otherwise, death for him would be unbearable. </p><p class="calibre_1">As long as we are alive, however, we may dally with any type of outlook we choose, a fact that is borne out by the constant deaths in sport and the refreshing rebirths that follow. Victory where the mind is concerned comes from the balance that is achieved in the face of ever-imminent destruction. </p><p class="calibre_1">Since my own mind was forever beset by boredom, all but the most difficult, virtually impossible tasks failed by now to arouse its interest. More specifically, it was no longer interested in anything save the dangerous type of game in which the mind put itself in peril—in the game, and in the refreshing “shower” that followed. </p><p class="calibre_1">At one time, one of the aims of my mind was to know how the man with a massive physique felt about the world around him. This was obviously a problem too great for mere knowledge to handle, for though knowledge may penetrate the darkness by using the many creeping vines of sensation and intuition as guide ropes, here the vines themselves were uprooted; the source that sought to know belonged to me, while the right to the inclusive sense of existence was granted to the other side. </p><p class="calibre_1">A little thought will make this clear. The sense of existence of a man with a massive physique must, in itself, be of the kind that embraces the whole world; for that man, considered as a object of knowledge, everything outside himself (including me) must necessarily be transferred onto the objective outside world experienced by bis senses. No accurate picture can be grasped under such circumstances unless one responds with a still more embracing awareness. It is like trying to know how the native of another country experiences existence; in such a case, all we can do is to apply inclusive, abstract concepts such as mankind, universal humanity, and so on, and to make deductions using these hypothetical yardsticks. This, however, is not an exact knowledge, but a method that leaves the ultimately unknowable elements untouched and deduces by analogy with the other, shared elements. The real question is staved off; the things one “really wants to know” are shelved. The only other alternative is for the imagination to take over unashamedly and adorn the other side with a whole variety of poems and fantasies. </p><p class="calibre_1">For me, however, all fantasy suddenly vanished. My bored mind had been chasing after the unintelligible when, abruptly, the mystery disintegrated ... Suddenly, it was I who had a fine physique. </p><p class="calibre_1">Thus, those who had been on the other side of the stream were here, on the same side as myself. The riddle had gone; death remained the only mystery. And since this freedom from riddles had been in no way a product of the mind, the latter’s pride was terribly hurt Somewhat defiantly, it began to yawn once more, once more began to sell itself to the detested imagination, and the only thing that belonged eternally to the imagination was death. </p><p class="calibre_1">Yet, where is the difference? If the deepest sources of the morbid imagination that falls on one by night —of the voluptuous imagination, inducer of sensual abandon—he, one and all, in death, how does that death differ from the glorious death? What distinguishes the heroic from the decadent death? The dual way’s cruel withholding of salvation proves that they are ultimately the same, and that the literary ethic and the ethic of action are no more than pathetic efforts of resistance against death and oblivion. </p><p class="calibre_1">What difference there might be resolves itself into the presence or absence of the idea of honor, which regards death as “something to be seen,” and the presence or absence of the formal aesthetic of death that goes with it—in other words, the tragic nature of the approach to death and the beauty of the body going to its doom. Thus, where a beautiful death is concerned, men are condemned to inequalities and degrees of fortune commensurate with the inequalities and degrees of fortune bestowed on them by fate at their birth—though this inequality is obscured nowadays by the fact that modern man is almost devoid of the desire of the ancient Greeks to live “beautifully” and die “beautifully.” </p><p class="calibre_1">Why should a man be associated with beauty only through a heroic, violent death ? In ordinary life, society maintains a careful surveillance to ensure that men shall have no part in beauty; physical beauty in the male, when considered as an “object” in itself without any intermediate agent, is despised, and the profession of the male actor—which involves constantly being “seen”—is far from being accorded true respect. A strict rule is imposed where men are concerned. It is this: a man must under normal circumstances never permit his own objectivization; he can only be objectified through the supreme action—which is, I suppose, the moment of death, the moment when, even without being seen, the fiction of being seen and the beauty of the object are permitted. Of such is the beauty of the suicide squad, which is recognized as beauty not only in the spiritual sense but, by men in general, in an ultra-erotic sense also. Moreover, serving as agent in this case is a heroic action of an intensity beyond the resources of the ordinary mortal, so that “objectivization” without an agent is not possible here. However close mere words may get to this moment of supreme action that acts as intermediary for beauty, they can no more overtake it than a flying body can attain the speed of light. </p><p class="calibre_1">But what I was trying to describe here was not beauty. To discuss beauty is to discuss the question “in depth.” This was not my intention: what I sought to do was to arrange a great variety of ideas like dice of hard ivory and to set limits to the function of each. </p><p class="calibre_1">I discovered, then, that the profoundest depths of the imagination lay in death. It is natural, perhaps, that quite apart from the necessity to prepare defenses against the encroachments of the imagination, I should have conceived the idea of turning the imagination that had so long tormented me back on itself, changing it into something that I could use as a weapon for counterattack. However, where art as such was concerned, my style had already built forts here, there, and everywhere, and was successfully holding the encroachments of the imagination in check. If I was to plan such a counterattack, it must take place in some field outside that of art. It was this, more than anything else, that first drew me towards the idea of the martial arts. </p><p class="calibre_1">At one time, I had been the type of boy who leaned at the window, forever watching out for unexpected events to come crowding in towards him. Though I might be unable to change the world myself, I could not but hope that the world would change of its own accord. As that kind of boy, with all the accompanying anxieties, the transformation of the world was an urgent necessity for me; it nourished me from day to day; it was something without which I could not have lived. The idea of the changing of the world was as much a necessity as sleep and three meals a day. It was the womb that nourished my imagination. </p><p class="calibre_1">What followed in practice was in one sense a transformation of the world, in another it was not. Even though the world might change into the kind I hoped for, it lost its rich charm at the very instant of change. The thing that lay at the far end of my dreams was extreme danger and destruction; never once had I envisaged happiness. The most appropriate type of daily life for me was a day-by-day world destruction; peace was the most difficult and abnormal state to live in. </p><p class="calibre_1">Unfortunately, I lacked the physical wherewithal to cope with this. Wearing upon my sleeve a susceptibility that knew no way of resistance, I watched out for the unexpected, telling myself that when it came I would accept it rather than struggle with it. Much later, I realized that if the psychological life of this excessively decadent youth had happened to be backed up by strength and the will to fight, it would have constituted a perfect analogy with the life of the warrior. It was an oddly exhilarating discovery. In making it, I put within my grasp the opportunity to turn the imagination back on itself. </p><p class="calibre_1">If the only natural world for me was one in which death was an everyday, self-evident matter, and if what was natural to me was very easily attainable, not through artificial devices, but by means of perfectly unoriginal concepts of duty, then nothing could be more natural than that I should gradually succumb to temptation and seek to replace imagination by duty. No moment is so dazzling as when everyday imaginings concerning death and danger and world destruction are transformed into duty. To do this, however, required the nurturing of the body, of the strength and will to fight, and the techniques to fight with. Their development could be entrusted to the same type of methods as had once served to develop the imagination; for were not the imagination and swordsmanship the same insofar as they were techniques nurtured by a familiarity with death ? Both were techniques, moreover, that led one closer and closer towards destruction the more sensitive they became. </p><p class="calibre_1">I now realize that the kind of task in which to burnish the imagination for death and danger comes to have the same significance as burnishing the sword, had long been calling to me from a distance; only weakness and cowardice had made me avoid it. </p><p class="calibre_1">To keep death in mind from day to day, to focus each moment upon inevitable death, to make sure one’s worst forebodings coincided with one’s dreams of glory... if that was all, then it was sufficient to transfer to the world of the flesh what I had long been doing in the world of the spirit. </p><p class="calibre_1"> I have already written of how assiduously I was making preparations for accepting such a wrenching change, getting myself ready to accept it at any time. The theory that anything could be recovered had come into being within me. As it had become clear that even the body — ostensibly the prisoner of time in its moment-to-moment growth and decline — could be recovered, then it was not odd that I should conceive the idea of time itself as recoverable. </p><p class="calibre_1">For me, the idea that time was recoverable meant that the beautiful death that had earlier eluded me had also become possible. What was more, during the past ten years I had learned strength, I had learned suffering, battle, and self-conquest; I had learned the courage to accept them all with joy. </p><p class="calibre_1">I was beginning to dream of my capabilities as a fighting man. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_5"></div>
