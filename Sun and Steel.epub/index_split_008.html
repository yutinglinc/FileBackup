The army is a profession that requires a great deal of technique. As I saw and noted well for myself, it demands, more than any other profession, a long period of careful training. In order not to lose the techniques once they are acquired, constant and unrelaxing practice is necessary, much as a pianist must practice every day in order not to lose his delicacy of touch. </p><p class="calibre_1">Nothing gives the armed forces so much attraction as the fact that even the most trivial duty is ultimately an emanation of something far loftier and more glorious, and is linked, somewhere, with the idea of death. The man of letters, on the other hand, must scratch together his own glory from the rubbish within himself, already overfamiliar in every detail, and refurbish it for the public eye. </p><p class="calibre_1">Two different voices constantly call to us. One comes from within, the other from without. The one from without is one’s daily duty. If the part of the mind that responded to duty corresponded exactly with the voice from within, then one would indeed be supremely happy. </p><p class="calibre_1">On a May afternoon of unseasonably cold drizzle, I was alone in the dormitory, the firing practice that I had been due to witness having been cancelled on account of the rain. It was chilly there on the plain skirting the foot of Mt. Fuji, more like a winter’s day than early summer. On such a day, tall city buildings where men worked would be aglow with lights even in the daytime, and the women at home would be knitting by artificial light, or watching the television, perhaps repenting having put the gas fires away too soon. Ordinary bourgeois life held no force sufficiently compelling to drag one out into the chill drizzle without so much as an umbrella. </p><p class="calibre_1">Unexpectedly, a non-commissioned officer arrived in a jeep to fetch me. The firing practice, he explained, was going ahead despite the rain. </p><p class="calibre_1">The jeep drove steadily along the potholed road across the plain, lurching violently as it went. </p><p class="calibre_1">Not a soul was in sight on the plain. The jeep climbed a slope down which the rain washed in sheets, and drove down the other side again. Visibility was restricted, the wind gathered strength, and the clumps of grass bowed down before it. From a gap in the hood, the cold rain beat mercilessly on my cheeks. </p><p class="calibre_1">I was glad that they had come from the plain to fetch me on such a day. It was an emergency duty, a voice summoning me lustily from afar. The feeling of hastily leaving a warm lair in response to a voice calling from across the vast rain-blurred plain had a primitive appeal that I had not savored for many a day. </p><p class="calibre_1">On such occasions, something unknown compels me, almost tears me away from the warm fireside. There is no reluctance or hesitation: I gladly go to meet the messenger from the ends of the earth (in most cases he has some connection with death or pleasure or instinct) and, in the instant of my departure, I abandon everything that is comfortable and familiar. I had, I felt, savored just such a moment long ago in the distant past. </p><p class="calibre_1">In the past, though, the voice that had called me from without had not corresponded precisely to the voice from within. This, I believe, is because I was unable to meet the call from without with my body, managing barely to do so with words instead. I was familiar, it is true, with the sweet pain that occurred when it became entangled in the complex mesh of ideas, but I was ignorant as yet of the deep-rooted joy produced when the two types of summons, meeting in the body, find themselves perfectly matched. </p><p class="calibre_1">Before long, there came the high-pitched whine of the guns, and I caught sight of the bright orange tracer shells being fired, with repeated corrections for error, at targets half obscured by the drifting rain. The next hour I spent sitting in the mire, with the rain beating down on me. </p><p class="calibre_1">...I recall another memory. </p><p class="calibre_1">I was running alone, one December 14, on the main track of the National Stadium beneath the first glimmerings of dawn. In reality, this kind of behavior was no more than a fictional “task”—a piece of drunken excess, one might well call it—yet I have never felt so keenly that I was enjoying the ultimate in extravagance, nor have I ever felt so sure that the daybreak belonged to me alone. </p><p class="calibre_1">It was a freezing dawn. The National Stadium was a great lily of which the vast arena, utterly deserted, formed the overblown, speckled, greyish-white petals. </p><p class="calibre_1">I wore only a running shirt and pants; the morning breeze struck chill to the bone; my hands were soon numb. As I passed the gloom in front of the stands on the east side, the cold was daunting; the west side, on which the first rays of the sun were already striking, was more bearable. I had circled the 400-meter track four times, and was on my fifth time round. </p><p class="calibre_1">The sun peering over the top of the stands was still intercepted by the edge of the lily’s petals, and the magenta of a reluctant dawn still lingered in the sky. The east side of the stadium, was touched by the last of the cold night-breeze. </p><p class="calibre_1">As I ran, I breathed not only the knife-sharp air but the lingering aroma of the dawn. The tumult, the cries of joy from the stands, the smell of athlete’s lotion heightened by the morning chill, the pounding of red hearts, the fierce resolve—of such was compounded the fragrance of that great lily, a fragrance that the stadium had retained all through the night. And the brick red of the track was, unmistakably, the color of the lily’s pollen. </p><p class="calibre_1">As I ran, my mind was filled with one idea: the relationship between the voluptuous lily of dawn and the purity of the body. </p><p class="calibre_1">So completely did this difficult metaphysical problem engross me that I went on running, oblivious to fatigue. It was a problem that, somewhere deep down, related to myself; it linked up with my boyhood hypocrisy concerning the purity and sanctity of the body; and it had its bearing, I suspected, on the distant martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. </p><p class="calibre_1">The reader is asked to notice that I say nothing of my own everyday life. My intention is to talk only of the several mysteries to which I have been party. </p><p class="calibre_1">Running, too, was a mystery. It immediately placed a non-routine burden on the heart, washing away the emotions of the daily round. Before long, my blood would not permit a halt of even a day or two. Something ceaselessly set me to work; my body could no longer tolerate indolence, but began instantly to thirst for violent action, forever urging me on. Thus for many a day I led a life that others might well dismiss as frenzied obsession. From the gymnasium to the fencing school, from the school to the gymnasium. ... My solace lay more than anywhere — indeed lay solely — in the small rebirths that occurred immediately after exercise. Ceaseless motion, ceaseless violent deaths, ceaseless escape from cold objectivity—by now, I could no longer live without such mysteries. And—needless to say—within each mystery there lay a small imitation of death. </p><p class="calibre_1">All unawares, I had embarked on a kind of pitiless , round. My age pursued me, murmuring behind my back “How long will it last ?” Yet so firmly was I in the clutches of my healthy vice that to go back to the world of words without the mystery of these rebirths was no longer possible. </p><p class="calibre_1">This does not imply, of course, that after my small rebirths of the soul and the flesh I went back reluctantly, with a sense of duty, to the world of words. On the contrary, this was the one procedure that ensured that I should return to them joyfully and with a glad heart. </p><p class="calibre_1">The demands I made on words became still more strict and exacting. I shunned the latest styles like the plague. Perhaps I was gradually seeking to rediscover the unsullied fortress of words that I had known during the war. </p><p class="calibre_1">It may be that I was trying to reconstruct everything according to the pattern that I had learned before, to find once more my fortress of words—that paradoxical base of freedom outside which I was forever threatened, yet inside which I enjoyed an unparalleled freedom. </p><p class="calibre_1">It was also an attempt to recapture the intoxication I experienced, free from guilt about words, at that age when I asked words to fulfill only the purest of functions. And that meant trying to recover my own self as it had been when eaten away by the white ants of words, and to reinforce it with a sturdy body. It was an attempt to restore a state of affairs in which words (however far they might be from the truth) were for me the only source of real happiness and freedom, much as a child will put a backing of thick strong paper on a backgammon board that long use has severed at the fold. It meant, in a sense, a return to the poem without pain, a return to my private Golden Age. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_8"></div>
