A quarter-century’s experience of life since then has added nothing to what I knew. The one difference is that at seventeen I had no “realism.” </p><p class="calibre_1">How wonderful it would be, I felt, if I could only go back to that omniscience in which I bathed as agreeably as in cold water in summer! Examining myself in detail as I was at that age, I found that the parts of me that my words had without doubt “ended” were extremely few, and that the areas polluted by the radiation of omniscience were very restricted. The reason was that, though I wanted to use words as a memorial, as my bequest to posterity, I had got the method wrong: I was cutting down on—even rejecting—omniscience, and entrusting to words the whole of my rebellion against the age. I was preoccupied with the task of making words reflect my body, even though I had none, and of sending them winging off towards the future, or towards death, bearing my longings like a carrier pigeon bearing a message in the silver tube attached to its small red leg. Even though one might be justified in describing this process as one designed not to let words come to an end, there was, nevertheless, a kind of intoxication in it. </p><p class="calibre_1">Earlier, I defined the essential function of words as a kind of magic in which the long void spent waiting for the absolute is progressively consumed by writing, much as embroidery slowly covers the pure white of a long sash. At the same time, I pointed out that the spirit— which, chopped into lengths by words, has its natural sense of the continuity of life constandy disrupted—is unable to distinguish a true end, and thus never knows an end at all. </p><p class="calibre_1">If that is so, what function do words have for the spirit when it finally does become aware of the end ? </p><p class="calibre_1">An admirable example in miniature of what happens in such a case is to be found in a collection of letters, written by young men of the suicide squad before setting off on their last mission, that is preserved today at the former naval base of Etajima. </p><p class="calibre_1">Visiting the museum one late summer’s day, I was struck by the remarkable contrast between the majority of letters, which were written in an impressive, orderly style, and the occasional letter rapidly dashed off in pencil. As I stood before the glass cases reading the last testaments of these young heroes, I felt suddenly that I had resolved a question that had long worried me: at such times, did men use words to tell the truth, or did they try to make of them some memorial ? </p><p class="calibre_1">One letter that still remains very vivid in my mind was written in pencil on a piece of rice-paper in a youthful, almost careless scribble. If my memory is not mistaken, it was to the following effect, and broke off abruptly in just this fashion: </p><p class="calibre_1">"At the moment I am full of life, my whole body overflowing with youth and strength. It seems impossible that I shall be dead in three hours’ time. And yet...” </p><p class="calibre_1">When someone seeks to tell the truth, words always falter in this way. I can almost see him now, fumbling for words: not from shyness, nor from fear, for the naked truth inevitably produces this verbal stumbling; but, rather, as a sign of a certain rough quality about truth itself. The young man in question had no long-drawn-out void left in which to await the absolute, nor did he have time to wind things up with words in a leisurely way. As he hurtled towards death, his final everyday phrases seized on a moment when the feeling for life, like chloroform in the strange headiness it produces, had temporarily benumbed his spirit’s awareness of the end, and, like a well-loved dog leaping up at its master, came rushing out upon him, only to be dashed rudely aside. </p><p class="calibre_1">The neater letters, on the other hand, with their pithy phrases about duty to one’s fatherland, destroying the enemy, eternal right, and the identity of life and death, obviously selected what were considered to be the most impressive, the most noble from among a large number of ready-made concepts, and clearly revealed a determination, by eliminating anything in the way of personal psychology, to identify the self with the splendid words chosen. </p><p class="calibre_1">The slogan-like phrases thus written were, of course, in every sense “words.” But, ready made though they might have been, they were special words, set at a height loftier than any commonplace action could ever attain. </p><p class="calibre_1">Once there were such words, though they are lost to us nowadays. They were not simply beautiful phrases, but a constant summons to superhuman behavior, words that demanded that the individual stake his very life on the attempt to climb to their own lofty heights. Words such as these, in which something first uttered as a conscious resolve gradually comes to demand an inescapable identification, lacked from the outset any bridge that might link them with ordinary, everyday preoccupations. More than any other words, and despite the ambiguity of their sense and content, they were filled with a glory not of this world; their very impersonality and monumentality demanded the strict elimination of individuality and spurned the construction of monuments based on personal action. If the concept of the hero is a physical one, then, just as Alexander the Great acquired heroic stature by modeling himself on Achilles, the conditions necessary for becoming a hero must be both a ban on originality and a true faithfulness to a classical model; unlike the words of a genius, the words of a hero must be selected as the most impressive and noble from among ready-made concepts. And at the same time they, more than any other words, constitute a splendid language of the flesh. </p><p class="calibre_1">In this way, then, I discovered in that museum the two brave types of words used when the spirit has perceived its end. </p><p class="calibre_1">Compared with these two, the works of my boyhood failed to get to grips with the certainty of death; with ample time to be poisoned by timidity, they were subject in equal measure to the assaults of art. I used words in a totally different way from those beautiful last testaments of the suicide corps. Nevertheless, it seems certain that my spirit, for all the freedom—license, even—it permitted to words, and for all the prodigality it permitted the youthful author in his use of them, was still, somewhere, aware of the “end.” If one rereads those works now, the signs are plain for all to see. </p><p class="calibre_1">Nowadays, I find myself speculating: the kind of life in which words appear first, followed by the body already corroded by words, was surely not confined to myself alone? I was surely, somewhere, guilty of a contradiction in rejecting my own uniqueness while affirming the uniqueness of my life as such; the unconscious education of my body should have made the contradiction quite plain to me. At that period, then, the “end” that the body foresaw and the spirit perceived must have been present in the suicide corps and myself in equal measure. I ought to have been able (even without the body!) to take up a stand at some point that left no doubt as to that identity, and among the young men who died—even, indeed, among the suicide corps—there were, beyond doubt, some who were eaten away by the white ants in the same way as myself. Those who died, however, were fortunately secure within a fixed identity, an identity established beyond all doubt—the tragic identity. </p><p class="calibre_1">My omniscience at seventeen could hardly have been unaware of this. However, what I had begun was the attempt to remove myself as far as possible from omniscience. Determined not to use even one of the materials of which the age was built, I mistook obstinate persistence in my own views for purity; what was worse, I mistook my method too, and sought to leave behind a personal monument. How, though, could something personal ever become a monument ? The basic reason for this illusion is only too clear to me today; at that time I held in contempt a life that could be ended by words. </p><p class="calibre_1">Thus contempt and fear were synonymous in the eyes of the boy that I was then. In all probability, I was afraid of bringing it to an end with words, and yet, imagining that imperishability for words lay in escaping as far as possible from reality, I felt an intoxication in this fruitless action. One might say that there was happiness—hope, even—in the action. And when the war ended and the spirit promptly ceased to be aware of the coming “end,” the intoxication also ceased on the spot. </p><p class="calibre_1">What, then, could be the real meaning of my attempt at this late stage to return to the same point? Was it freedom I was seeking? Or the impossible? Or did the two things, possibly, come to the same thing? </p><p class="calibre_1">What I was after, obviously, was a revival of the intoxication, and this time, in addition to the intoxication, I was conceited enough to believe that my technique in dealing with words was sufficiently practiced for me to choose impersonal words, thereby enhancing their function as a memorial and putting an end to life of my own free will. This—it would be no exaggeration to say— was the only revenge I could take on the spirit for stubbornly refusing to perceive the “end.” I was loath to take the same course as others who, when the body is turning its steps towards its future decay, refuse to follow it but silently tag along after the far blinder and more stubborn spirit until they are completely deceived by it. </p><p class="calibre_1">Somehow or other, I must make my spirit conscious once more of the “end.” Everything started from there; only there, it was clear, could I find a basis for true freedom. I must soak myself once more in the cold water of my boyhood omniscience, fresh as a cold bath in summer, the omniscience that the misapplication of words had made me deliberately avoid; but this time I must give expression to everything, including the water itself. </p><p class="calibre_1">That such a return was impossible was obvious without my being told. Yet the impossibility stimulated my mind in its boredom, and the mind, which could no longer be aroused to action save by the impossible, was beginning to have dreams of freedom. </p><p class="calibre_1">I had already seen, in the paradox enacted by the body, the ultimate form of the freedom that comes through literature, the freedom that comes through words. Be that as it may, that which had eluded me was not death. It was tragedy that I had once let slip. </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_9"></div>
